git clone https://github.com/azukauteh/alx-system_engineering-devops.git
  cd 0x0C-web-server
```

3. Compile the source code using the provided build tools or commands.

4. Run the compiled executable to start the web server.

## Usage

Once the web server is running, you can access it using a web browser or tools like cURL. The server will respond to HTTP requests and serve the appropriate content based on the requested resources.
