# 0x12. Web Stack Debugging #2

This directory contains debugging solutions and documentation for Web Stack Debugging #2. The goal of this project is to debug and fix issues in a web application to ensure it functions correctly and efficiently.

## Project Description

In this project, we focus on identifying and resolving bugs, errors, or performance issues in a web application. The debugging process involves understanding the codebase, identifying problematic areas, and implementing fixes to enhance the application's functionality.

## Getting Started

To get started with debugging, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/azukauteh/alx-system_engineering-devops.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd 0x12-web_stack_debugging_2
```

## Debugging Process

1. Analysis : Begin by analyzing the existing codebase and identifying potential issues that need debugging.

2. Reproduction : Reproduce the identified issue to understand its behavior and gather relevant information for debugging.

3. Isolation : Isolate the problematic area or code that is causing the issue.

4. Research : Conduct research to understand the specific technology, frameworks, or tools being used, and identify common issues related to the problem.

5. Fixing : Implement appropriate fixes to resolve the identified issue while adhering to best practices and maintaining code quality.

6. Testing: Verify the fix by testing the application to ensure the issue is resolved and doesn't introduce new problems.

7. Documentation: Update this README file to document the issue, the steps taken to debug, and the resolution.
