# 0x0E. Web Stack Debugging #1

This directory contains solutions and explanations for the Web Stack Debugging project, which is part of the alx_Africa software engineering School curriculum. The project focuses on debugging a web application and understanding the various components of the web stack.

## Project Description

In this project, we are tasked with debugging a faulty web application. The application is built using a specific web stack, and our goal is to identify and fix any issues to make it functional.

## Files

- ` 0-nginx_likes_port_80`: Nginx installation from listening on port 80.
- `1-debugging_made_short`: Make it sweet and short.

## File Descriptions

1. **0-give_me_a_page**
   - This script is designed to fix a web server and ensure that it returns a page. It involves diagnosing and rectifying issues that prevent the web server from functioning correctly.

2. **1-transfer_file**
   - This script aims to fix a web server and enable the transfer of a specified file from the server to the client. Similar to the first script, it involves debugging and resolving issues in the web server configuration.
