Welcome to the 0x02 directory on Shell, I/O Redirections, and Filters! This directory covers essential information and examples related to input/output (I/O) redirection and filters in Unix-based systems. Understanding how to manipulate input and output streams and use filters effectively is crucial for efficient command-line usage.

## Introduction

In Unix-based systems, the shell allows you to interact with various commands and utilities using input and output streams. I/O redirections enable you to redirect standard input, standard output, and standard error to and from files or other commands. Filters, on the other hand, are commands that process input data and produce output based on specific rules. This repository will guide you through using I/O redirections and filters effectively.

## Shell Basics

Before diving into the content, let's quickly review some fundamental shell concepts:

- **Command Prompt**: The command prompt is where you type your commands. It typically displays information like the current working directory and the user's username.

- **Commands**: Shell commands are the instructions you give to the computer. They can be anything from simple file operations to complex system tasks.

- **Arguments**: Commands can take additional information called arguments. Arguments modify the behavior of commands or specify which files/directories the command should act upon.

- **Options**: Options are flags that modify the behavior of commands. They usually start with a dash (-) and can be combined together.

## I/O Redirections

I/O Redirections allow you to control where the input for a command comes from and where the output goes. You can redirect standard input, standard output, and standard error to or from files, and even combine multiple commands using pipes.

## Filters

Filters are commands that process input data and produce output based on specific rules or patterns. They are used in combination with I/O redirections and pipes to transform and manipulate data efficiently.
