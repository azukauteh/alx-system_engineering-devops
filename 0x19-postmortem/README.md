# Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

## Overview

This document provides a postmortem analysis of a recent web stack outage incident. The incident impacted the availability of our primary web service, resulting in degraded user experience. The purpose of this postmortem is to detail the duration, impact, root cause, timeline of events, and corrective/preventative measures taken.

## Incident Details

- Duration:
  - Start Time: [Timestamp]
  - End Time: [Timestamp]
  - Timezone: [Specify Timezone]

- Impact:
  - The outage led to a 30% degradation in user experience.
  - Users experienced slow response times, intermittent errors, and difficulties accessing key features.

- Root Cause:
  - The root cause was a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, causing uneven distribution of traffic among backend servers.

## Timeline

- Issue Detected:
  - [Timestamp]: Monitoring alerts indicated a significant increase in server response times.

- Detection Method:
  - The monitoring system triggered an alert based on abnormal latency patterns and error rates.

- Actions Taken:
  - Incident response team initiated investigations into servers, databases, and network infrastructure.
  - Initial assumptions pointed towards a potential DDoS attack.

- Misleading Paths:
  - Resources were allocated to investigate server logs for signs of malicious activity.

- Escalation:
  - Incident was escalated to system administrators and network engineers.

- Resolution:
  - Root cause identified as a misconfigured load balancer.
  - Load balancer settings adjusted to evenly distribute traffic.

## Root Cause and Resolution

- Cause Analysis:
  - Misconfiguration in the load balancer led to an overload on a specific backend server.

- Resolution Details:
  - Load balancer settings were corrected to evenly distribute traffic.
  - Manual intervention required to redistribute existing connections.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

- Improvements/Fixes:
  - Enhanced monitoring systems to provide real-time insights into load balancer performance.
  - Conducted a thorough review of load balancer configurations.

- Task List:
  - Task 1: Implement automated checks for load balancer settings.
  - Task 2: Develop standardized process for load balancer adjustments.
  - Task 3: Conduct training sessions for operations team.

## Conclusion

This postmortem provides insights into the incident's duration, impact, root cause, and the steps taken for resolution. The outlined corrective and preventative measures aim to strengthen our infrastructure and minimize the likelihood of similar incidents in the future.
