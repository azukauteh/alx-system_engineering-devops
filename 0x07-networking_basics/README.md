## Introduction

In this project, we explore the basics of computer networking. We delve into the concepts and technologies that form the foundation of communication between devices on a network. Understanding networking principles is crucial for anyone working in the field of software development, systems administration, or cybersecurity.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

1. Understand the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model and its layers.

2. Learn about common network protocols and their functionalities.

3. Familiarize with network topologies and architectures.

4. Gain hands-on experience with basic networking commands.

## Requirements

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

All your Bash script files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

All your files should end with a new line

All your Bash script files must be executable

Your Bash script must pass shellcheck without any error

The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env bash

The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing


## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you will need a Linux-based operating system, as most of the networking tools and commands we use are readily available on Linux distributions. We recommend using a virtual machine with a Linux installation if you don't have a Linux environment already set up.

Once you have a suitable environment, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/azukauteh/alx-system_engineering-devops
```
