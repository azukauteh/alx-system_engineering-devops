## Repository Contents

The project directory contains the following files:

- `0-change_your_home_IP`:  Bash script that configures an Ubuntu server  Bash.
- `1-show_attached_IPs':  Bash script that displays all active IPv4 IPs on the machine itâ€™s executed on.
- `100-port_listening_on_localhost`: A script that lists all listening ports on the machine (alternative implementation).
