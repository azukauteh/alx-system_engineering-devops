## Introduction

In Unix-based systems, file permissions are used to determine who can read, write, and execute files or directories. Properly setting permissions ensures that sensitive information is protected and unauthorized users cannot modify critical files. This repository will help you understand how to work with file permissions effectively.

## File Permissions

Before diving into the content, let's cover some basic file permission concepts:

- **Owner, Group, Others**: In Unix, each file or directory has three types of users: the owner (the user who created the file), the group (a collection of users), and others (everyone else).

- **Read, Write, Execute**: Each user type can have three types of permissions: read (r), write (w), and execute (x). These permissions determine what actions can be performed on the file or directory.

- **Numeric Representation**: File permissions can also be represented in numeric form using a three-digit number (e.g., 755, 644). Each digit corresponds to the permissions for the owner, group, and others, respectively.
