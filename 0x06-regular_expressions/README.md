## 1. Introduction
Welcome to the README for the "Regular Expression (Regex)" project. This document serves as a guide to understanding regular expressions and their usage in text processing, pattern matching, and data extraction.

## 2. What is Regular Expression (Regex)?
Regular Expression, commonly known as Regex, is a powerful tool used for matching and manipulating text patterns in strings. It provides a concise and flexible way to find, replace, or extract specific information from textual data.

## 3. Basic Regex Syntax
A regex is composed of a sequence of characters that form a search pattern. It can include letters, digits, special characters, and metacharacters. Some of the fundamental metacharacters include `.` (dot), `*` (asterisk), `+` (plus), `?` (question mark), and `|` (pipe).

## 4. Matching Characters and Quantifiers
Learn how to match specific characters and use quantifiers to specify the number of occurrences. Examples include using `[ ]` for character classes and `{ }` for specifying minimum and maximum occurrences.

## 5. Character Classes and Shorthand Character Classes
Discover the power of character classes, which allow you to match a set of characters. Shorthand character classes, like `\d` (digits), `\w` (word characters), and `\s` (whitespace), provide a convenient way to match common character groups.

## 6. Anchors and Boundaries
Understand how to use anchors to match positions in a string, such as the beginning `^` and end `$`. Boundaries, represented by `\b`, help match whole words.

## 7. Grouping and Capturing
Explore grouping with parentheses, which allows you to apply quantifiers to multiple characters. Additionally, learn how to use capturing groups to extract specific parts of a matched pattern.

## 8. Alternation
Discover the concept of alternation, using the `|` character, which allows you to match one of multiple expressions.

## 9. Backreferences
Learn how to use backreferences to match the same text that was previously captured by a group.

## 10. Lookaround Assertions
Understand lookaround assertions, including positive lookahead `(?=...)` and negative lookahead `(?!...)`, which allow you to assert conditions without consuming the characters.

## 11. Practical Examples
See real-world examples of regex usage, including email validation, phone number extraction, and data cleaning.

## 12. Conclusion
Summarize the main concepts and benefits of regular expressions.
